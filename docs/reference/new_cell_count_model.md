  Arguments
  ---------
    
    ccs
  
  A Hooke cell\_count\_set object.
  
  main\_model\_formula\_str
  
  A character string specifying the model of cell abundances across samples, where terms refer to columns in`colData(ccs)`. Put main effects here.
  
  nuisance\_model\_formula\_str
  
  A character string specifying the model of cell abundances across samples. Put nuisance effects here.
  
  penalty\_matrix
  
  A numeric NxN symmetric matrix specifying penalties for the PLN model, where N is the number of cell types. Entries must be positive and the rows and columns must be named with the cell\_group names. Use to specify an undirected graph prior for the PLN model.
  
  whitelist
  
  list A data frame with two columns corresponding to (undirected) edges that should receive min\_penalty. The columns are integers that refer to cell clusters.
  
  blacklist
  
  list A data frame with two columns corresponding to (undirected) edges that should receive max\_penalty. The columns are integers that refer to cell clusters.
  
  sparsity\_factor
  
  A positive number to control how sparse the PLN network is. Larger values make the network more sparse. edges that should receive min\_penalty. The columns are either cell\_group names or integers that refer to cell\_groups in penalty\_matrix.
  
  base\_penalty
  
  numeric A factor that scales the penalty matrix.
  
  min\_penalty
  
  numeric A positive value that is assigned to whitelisted penalty matrix elements, which over-write existing values.
  
  max\_penalty
  
  numeric A positive value that is assigned to blacklisted penalty matrix elements. which over-write existing values.
  
  verbose
  
  logical Whether to emit verbose output.
  
  pseudocount
  
  integer A value added to the elements of the initial cell\_count\_set matrix.
  
  pln\_min\_ratio
  
  numeric Used in the definition of the sparsity penalty grid.
  
  pln\_num\_penalties
  
  integer Number of penalty values for the internally generated penalty grid.
  
  vhat\_method
  
  string Method used to compute covariance matrix?
    
    num\_bootstraps
  
  positive integer Number of iterations used with the bootstrap vhat\_method.
  
  inception
  
  Not used.
  
  backend
  
  Method used to run bootstrap iterations.
  
  Value
  -----
    
    a new cell\_count\_model object
