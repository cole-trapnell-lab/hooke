      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) experiments allow us to track cell
        populations between conditions and experiments. The <strong>Hooke</strong> package
        provides a toolkit for analyzing changes in single-cell populations.
      </p>
     
<!-- 
      <p>Monocle 3 can help you perform three main types of analysis:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clustering, classifying, and counting cells.</strong> Single-cell
            RNA-Seq experiments allow you to discover new (and possibly rare) subtypes of
            cells. Monocle 3 helps you identify them.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Constructing single-cell trajectories.</strong> In development,
            disease, and throughout life, cells transition from one state to another.
            Monocle 3 helps you discover these transitions.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Differential expression analysis.</strong> Characterizing new cell
            types and states begins with comparisons to other, better understood cells.
            Monocle 3 includes a sophisticated, but easy-to-use system for differential
            expression.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>Hooke is currently in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta">beta phase</a>
            of its development. This means there are likely bugs and performance issues
            that will need to be addressed. We are working hard towards a stable release,
            but please be patient while Hooke is under construction.
          </p>
          
          <p>The documentation on this page is also still under construction. Not all
            features currently implemented have been completely documented.
